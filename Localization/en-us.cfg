        #ASSEX_ωMilkBarycenter_name = α Cen System
		#ASSEX_ωMilkBarycenter_desc = Alpha Centauri is a pair of multiple star systems, consisting of two large stars that are relatively close together and a distant, faint red dwarf star. Around that red dwarf, Proxima Centauri, we discovered a potentially habitable planet. This star system is very likely the first star system we will visit after entering the interstellar age.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_A_name = Alpha Centauri A
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_A_desc = Alpha Centauri A, a G2V main-sequence star with a mass slightly larger than that of the Sun, is the host star of this star system.

        #ASS_ωMilk_Ab_name = Alpha Centauri A b
        #ASS_ωMilk_Ab_desc = Alpha Centauri Ab is a ghostly object orbiting Alpha Centauri A at approximately 2 astronomical units. It is a controversial planet; for us, there is still no definitive evidence of its existence, and we know very little about it...

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_B_name = Alpha Centauri B
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_B_desc = Alpha Centauri B, the companion star of this relatively close binary system, is a K1V-type main-sequence star, making it appear more orange than its parent star, Alpha Centauri A. Alpha Centauri B has a mass approximately 90% that of the Sun. Alpha Centauri B has a mass of about 90% of that of the Sun. This star has been claimed to have been the subject of numerous previous discoveries of suspected orbiting stars, but none of these have been confirmed.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_C_name = Proxima Centauri
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_C_desc = Proxima Centauri is the closest star to our solar system, located in the constellation Centaurus in the southern hemisphere's night sky, currently about 4.25 light-years away. As a red dwarf star, it is much less bright and has a much lower mass than our Sun, with only 12.5% ​​of its mass. Currently, we have discovered several planets orbiting this dim red dwarf star. This star system could very well be our first stop on our journey out of the solar system and into the universe.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_Cc_name = Proxima Centauri d
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_Cc_desc = This is a dry and hot planet orbiting Proxima Centauri for about 5 days. At such a close distance, we believe that the planet is tidally locked to its parent star, with one side always facing the star and the other side facing away. In such an extreme environment, the liquid water on its sunlit side would have long since evaporated. However, such a small planet has almost no ability to maintain its atmosphere, so we believe that this planet is extremely dry.

		#ASSEX_ωMilk_Cd_desc = A super-Earth located within the habitable zone, it was once considered one of the closest Earth-like planets to our solar system and was also humanity's first stop on interstellar travel... From a distant observation, it appears to possess habitable temperatures and be within the habitable zone of its parent star. However, its parent star is a red dwarf. Even though the planet initially possessed a thick atmosphere and liquid water, with each powerful flare from its star, the planet's atmosphere gradually thinned. Ultimately, it couldn't hold out until Proxima Centauri reached a stable phase... Although it still had an atmosphere at this point, it was no longer useful; the low atmospheric pressure was unsuitable for the existence and development of life. Nevertheless, it can still serve as a milestone, marking humanity's first step out of the solar system...

        #ASS_ωMilk_Cb_desc = <color=#007D8C>This deep blue gaseous planet lurks in the distant outskirts of this dim red dwarf star system, cloaked in darkness by the backdrop of the starry sky... For years, the existence of this gaseous planet has been a matter of considerable debate, with some expressing strong skepticism. Due to its extreme distance and the inability to observe it via transits, we knew very little about this planet lurking in the darkness, even its mass being the only thing we knew.

		#ASSEX_ωMilkBarycenter1_desc = A binary star system, once the closest to the solar system, consisted of two stars with masses similar to our Sun and a red dwarf. Near this red dwarf, a planet similar to Earth, considered a potential harbor for life, was discovered. \nAt that time, this system aroused a lot of people's desire to explore, even though this star system is far away from us...

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_A1_name = α Cen A
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_A1_desc = <color=#8093E1>This dim, dense remnant is a perpetually burning light, ignited shortly after the death of the system's primary star... \n\nAlthough the original G-type star died not long ago, it is rapidly cooling due to the loss of its energy supply. Initially, the cooling is very rapid, but then the cooling rate will gradually slow... \n\nAt least, we can see it a few more times before it goes out...

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_B1_name = α Cen B
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_B1_desc = <color=#84B65D>This K-type orange dwarf star is nearing the end of its life. Having already entered the late main sequence phase, Alpha Centauri B is beginning to cool. However, this is not the end, nor the midpoint, but merely the beginning. Like our sun, it will gradually expand into a red giant, incinerating everything in its vicinity and becoming a massive, dazzling star. But before this, no one will be able to witness this happening.

        #ASSEX_ShuGeer_name = Barnard's Star
		#ASSEX_ShuGeer_desc = <color=#8F5542>Barnard's Star streaked across our night sky at a relatively high proper velocity before disappearing into the vastness of space. This famous star is the fourth closest star to our solar system and the closest star to us in the northern hemisphere. Although it was once so close, it was too dim to be seen with the naked eye due to its faint red dwarf magnitude of +9.5. Despite being a much smaller and dimmer star than our Sun, we have discovered and confirmed the existence of several planets orbiting this tiny red dot...

        #ASSEX_ShuGeerd_name = Barnard's Star d
		#ASSEX_ShuGeerd_desc = This is a hot, dry vacuum world. This vacuum rocky planet may be the closest planet to its parent star. At such a close distance, even if its parent star is a red dwarf, it will still be affected by its strong thermal radiation. In addition, it is tidally locked to the parent star. We estimate that there is an extreme temperature difference between the sun-facing side and the dark side of this planet, and the temperature on the sun-facing side can be as high as 500 degrees Celsius! \n\nAlthough its color appears to be flaming, we do not consider it a dangerous world.

        #ASSEX_ShuGeerb_name = Barnard's Star b
		#ASSEX_ShuGeerb_desc = This is a celestial body destroyed by a red dwarf star. During the pre-main sequence stage that lasted for hundreds of millions of years, the frequent flares of the star and the solar wind eruptions continuously stripped away its atmosphere and weakened its magnetic field. Eventually, the original thick atmosphere of the planet disappeared completely. If there was water on this planet, it would have evaporated. Now, it has become a dry world. \n But on the other side of the planet, where the star can never shine, there may still be solidified water.

        #ASSEX_ShuGeerc_name = Barnard's Star c
		#ASSEX_ShuGeerc_desc = This old planet was destroyed by a violent solar flare that erupted from this star system billions of years ago. We believe that even if this planet had an atmosphere in the past, it would not have lasted long because the planet is so small. Therefore, perhaps within tens of millions of years after the planet formed, its atmosphere was blown away by the strong stellar wind... \n Today, the planet is cold and dead, although tidally locked, the temperature on its dayside has risen to a level that seems suitable for life...

        #ASSEX_ShuGeere_name = Barnard's Star e
		#ASSEX_ShuGeere_desc = Today, this cold world still has an extremely thin atmosphere. According to our investigation, this atmosphere is mainly composed of carbon dioxide. Perhaps because of this, these "heavy gases" are not blown away by the stellar wind. \n\nBut we can still be sure that this is still a lifeless world...

        #ASSEX_Ruanxiao_name = Ran
		#ASSEX_Ruanxiao_desc = This is a relatively close K-type main-sequence star, one of the few stars visible to the naked eye in the night sky. Relative to the age of the Sun, it is relatively young, still in its main-sequence stage. Compared to red dwarfs, this type of star is much more stable and less volatile, and its lifespan is longer than that of G-type stars. For the search of habitable worlds, this type of star would be our first choice. However, we haven't observed any potentially habitable planets in this star system; it seems to have only one gas giant orbiting in a distant orbit. But this star is not alone. Besides that gas giant, we've also discovered two massive asteroid belts, larger and brighter than the Kuiper Belt... Perhaps these distant asteroid belts contain numerous giant asteroids composed of ice, perhaps serving as a refueling station?

        #ASSEX_Ruanxiaob_name = AEgir
		#ASSEX_Ruanxiaob_desc = AEgir is a celestial body orbiting the K-type Star Ran. This planet is the first planet we have discovered in this system and may also be the only one in this system. Judging from its appearance, its mass and volume are very close to Jupiter, a gas planet in the solar system. \nBut as a gas planet, it is obviously impossible for life to survive here.

		#ASSEX_Ruanxiaobb_desc = This is a cold, frozen world orbiting the giant gas planet below. From the outside, it appears smooth and flawless. If you just look at the appearance, this cold world not only has a thin atmosphere, but also extremely low temperatures, which is not suitable for the existence of life at all. But what if life does not exist above the surface? Instead, what if it exists in the ocean beneath the thick ice? \nBecause this object's orbit has a certain eccentricity, we believe this would generate large tidal forces, heating the object and causing it to melt deep within, thus forming an alien deep ocean like Enceladus in the past...

Because of its extremely dim luminosity, in the past, if you were in the solar system, you could only observe this dim red dwarf star through a large telescope. However, we have also discovered several planets around this dim red dwarf star. At the time of their discovery, people noticed that two of them were located in their habitable zone. They imagined them as two fascinating habitable worlds with thick atmospheres and liquid water oceans. However, the red dwarf stars in their young and violent phases frequently erupted with violent flares, which inevitably destroyed the atmospheres of the planets that approached them. Clearly, searching for planets around a red dwarf star is an unwise choice.

In the early 2000s, when observational technology was still immature, a new planet, "Gliese 581g," was falsely claimed to have been discovered. At that time, it was once considered a 100% habitable new world suitable for life. However, this supposedly 100% habitable world was never found by telescopes again, and "Gliese 581g" was eventually proven not to exist.

We believe that if it were a rocky planet, life might be possible here, but unfortunately it is not a rocky world.

As a red dwarf, it is virtually impossible to see it in the night sky because 55 Cancri B has an apparent magnitude of only 13, so it can only be observed through a telescope. Furthermore, the exact orbital parameters of 55 Cancri B are still unknown.

However, we speculate that this planet may be a mini Neptune rather than a rocky super-Earth.  \n\nAs for this planet, it was discovered in 2025 using the Doppler spectroscopy technique. According to our calculations, this planet is located at the outer edge of its parent star's habitable zone.
